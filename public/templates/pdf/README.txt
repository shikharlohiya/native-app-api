ESTIMATION TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place your estimation_template.pdf file in this directory.

2. The template should be a PDF file with placeholders for the following information:
   - Estimation ID (top left)
   - Date (top left)
   - Customer Name (top right)
   - Shed Length (middle section)
   - Shed Width (middle section)
   - Shed Area (calculated from length x width)

3. The controller will automatically fill in these details based on the user's input.

4. The coordinates in the controller (x, y positions) may need to be adjusted based on your specific template layout.

Note: You can upload a new template using the uploadEstimationTemplate function if needed.
