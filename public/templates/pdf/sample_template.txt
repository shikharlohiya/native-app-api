This is a placeholder for the PDF template.

Since we can't directly create a PDF file through this interface, you'll need to:

1. Create a PDF template that matches the format shown in your screenshot
2. Save it as "estimation_template.pdf" in this directory

The template should have placeholders for:
- Estimation ID (top left)
- Estimation Date (top left)
- Customer Name (top right)
- Shed dimensions (length, width, area)

The controller will fill in these values based on the user's input.
